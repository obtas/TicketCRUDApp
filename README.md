# TicketCRUDApp

## About App
Simple CRUD app created for a QA Apprenticeship assignment for the module 'Coding Fundamentals". When issues arise in the workplace, a platform is needed to capture the work requests made and manage the requests until they can be resolved. 

My app is designed to:
*	assign an ID to the tickets
*   display the date and time of ticket creation
*	display who it assigned to
*	display the severity of the ticket
*	display the status of the ticket
*	display the title 
*	display the notes

The app is written in Python and is console-based.
